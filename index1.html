                    Ingredients
                    For the Patties:
                    1 lb ground beef (80/20 for best flavor)
                    1 tsp salt
                    1/2 tsp black pepper
                    1 tsp garlic powder (optional)
                    1 tsp onion powder (optional)
                    For Assembly:
                    4 hamburger buns
                    4 slices of cheddar cheese (or cheese of choice)
                    Lettuce leaves
                    Tomato slices
                    Pickles
                    Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise (to taste)
                    Instructions
                    Prepare the Patties:
                    In a bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
                    Mix gently until just combined; avoid overworking the meat.
                    Divide the mixture into four equal portions and shape them into patties (about 3/4 inch thick). Make
                    a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent them from puffing up while cooking.
                    Cook the Patties:
                    Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat.
                    Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes on one side. Flip them and add a slice of cheese on top if
                    you want a cheeseburger.
                    Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes or until they reach your desired doneness (165°F for medium).
                    Toast the Buns:
                    If desired, toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a skillet until golden brown.
                    Assemble the Burger:
                    On the bottom half of each bun, place a lettuce leaf, followed by the patty (with cheese if using).
                    Add tomato slices, pickles, and your choice of condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise).
                    Top with the other half of the bun.
                    Serve:
                    Serve immediately with fries, chips, or a side salad.

                <div class="recipe-description" style="display: none;">
                    Ingredients
For the Dough:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup oil or ghee
1/2 tsp salt
Water (as needed)
For the Filling:
2 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed
1/2 cup green peas (fresh or frozen)
1 onion, finely chopped
1 tsp ginger-garlic paste
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander powder
1/2 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
1-2 green chilies, chopped (adjust to taste)
Salt (to taste)
Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (optional)
Oil (for frying)
Instructions
Prepare the Dough:
In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.
Add the oil or ghee and mix until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
Gradually add water to form a soft, pliable dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Prepare the Filling:
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat.
Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.
Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
Stir in the ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, and all the spices (coriander, garam masala, turmeric). Cook for a minute.
Add the mashed potatoes and peas, mixing well. Season with salt and cook for a few more minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.
Assemble the Samosas:
Divide the dough into equal portions (about 8-10).
Roll each portion into a ball and flatten it into a circle (about 6 inches in diameter).
Cut the circle in half to form two semi-circles.
Take one semi-circle and form a cone by folding it over, sealing the edge with a little water.
Fill the cone with the potato filling, then seal the open edge by pinching it together. Ensure it is sealed well.
Fry the Samosas:
Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
Once the oil is hot, carefully add the samosas in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels.
Serve:
Serve the samosas hot with mint chutney or tamarind sauce.

                    Ingredients
                    For the Pasta:
                    12 oz spaghetti (or pasta of choice)
                    1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
                    4-6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
                    1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
                    Salt (for pasta water)
                    Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
                    Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
                    Instructions
                    Cook the Pasta:
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
                    Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta
                    water, then drain the pasta.
                    Prepare the Sauce:
                    In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
                    Add the sliced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes, or until it turns golden brown. Be careful
                    not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter.
                    Add the red pepper flakes and sauté for an additional 30 seconds.
                    Combine Pasta and Sauce:
                    Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet, tossing it in the garlic oil to coat.
                    If the pasta seems dry, gradually add some reserved pasta water until you reach your desired
                    consistency.
                    Serve:
                    Remove from heat and toss in chopped parsley.
                    Plate the pasta and, if desired, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
